YOUR PROMISE TO PAY AND THE TERMS OF REPAYMENT. In consideration of the Amount Given to you Directly and to repay your loan, you
promise to pay the Principal Amount of Loan shown above together with Interest at the Agreed Rate of Interest Per Year. You agree to pay this
sum to us at our office in installments each month according to the terms of repayment shown above. The Principal Amount of Loan is the actual
amount of your loan and includes the Amount Financed ($	35.000.00	) plus the Administrative Fee ($	1,750.00 V The final installment is equal
in any case to the unpaid Principal Amount of Loan plus any unpaid Interest. The Administrative Fee is withheld from the proceeds of your loan, fully
earned on the date of your loan and must be repaid to satisfy the loan. A payment is considered made on the date we receive it. Each payment
will be applied first to all Interest due as of the date of payment, second to the unpaid Principal Amount of Loan, and then to any fees owing
(other than the Administrative Fee). Payment in any amount may be made in advance at any time.
PREPAYMENT. You can prepay your loan at any time without incuring any pre payment penalty.
INTEREST RATE CHARGE. Interest is payable on your loan at the Agreed Rate of Interest Per Year shown above and is calculated using the
simple interest method. Failure to pay any installment by the stated due date will result in the accrual of additional interest and may affect the amount
of your final installment. The monthly rate of interest is one-twelfth of this yearly rate. Interest will continue to accrue until the Principal Amount of Loan is
paid in full.
LATE CHARGE. If you are more than 15 days late in paying any part of an installment, you promise to pay a late charge equal to 5% of the
scheduled monthly payment.
DEFAULT - ENTIRE BALANCE DUE. If you fail to pay an installment on time or if you violate the other terms of this Loan Agreement, you will be in
default. When that happens, you agree that, without us giving you advance notice, we can require you to pay, in addition to any installment due, any
accrued interest, late charges, and/or the outstanding balance of this Loan Agreement in full immediately (including any unpaid Interest). We can
use any remedies available to us under the law. If we must sue you in a judicial proceeding, you agree that the Agreed Rate of Interest Per Year shown
above will continue to accrue before judgment and also after judgment until payment. However, if the term scheduled for payment under this Loan
Agree-
ment has expired, you agree that the remaining balance will accrue interest at the Agreed Rate of Interest Per Year shown above.
RETURN CHECK CHARGE. If a check or other instrument used to make payment on your loan is not honored because of insufficient funds or for
any other reason (except an error by us), you agree to pay us a $40.00 charge.
COLLECTION COSTS. If we refer this Loan Agreement to an attorney after you default, you agree to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred
by us. You also agree to pay all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred or sustained by us while enforcing any security interest we may have
in connection with this Loan Agreement.
OTHER RIGHTS. You agree that any delay or failure to enforce our rights under this Loan Agreement does not prevent us from enforcing any such
rights at a later time.
ADDITIONAL SIGNERS. If you sign this Loan Agreement as a Co-Signer, you agree to remain responsible for this loan even if we fail to notify you
that it has not been paid. You also agree to remain responsible if we change the terms of payment or release any security without notifying you.
